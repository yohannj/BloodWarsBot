# BloodWarsBot
**BloodWarsBot** is a greasemonkey script that can play autonomously on any french servers of the browser base MMORPG BloodWars.

The script is a Proof Of Concept provided as is, for educational purpose.
It manages all actions that are currently available in game, including participating in auctions. It can recover any type of deconnection (connexion loss, user based deconnection, etc.) by reconnecting later on.

## Disclaimer
BloodWars forbid the use of a bot. I do not recommend using this script, and am not responsible for any consequences which may occur if you do so.
